***Project Title: Data Cleansing Python Script***

**Overview:**
This Python script is designed to clean raw data stored in CSV files using the pandas library. It automates the process of removing blank rows, stripping column names of any leading or trailing whitespace, and converting data types as necessary. The cleaned data is then saved to new CSV files for further analysis or use.

**System Requirements:**
Python 3.x
pandas library

**Setup Instructions:**
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Install the pandas library by running pip install pandas in your terminal or command prompt.
Place the raw CSV files that need to be cleaned in the same directory as the script.

**Usage Instructions:**
Open the Python script in a text editor or IDE.
Modify the script to specify the filenames of the raw CSV files you want to clean.
Run the script by executing python data_cleansing.py in your terminal or command prompt.
The script will read each CSV file, clean the data, and save the cleaned data to new CSV files in the same directory.

**Conclusion:**
This Python script provides a convenient way to clean raw data stored in CSV files, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the data. By following the setup and usage instructions, users can efficiently clean their data and prepare it for further analysis or processing.
